# Video Hub App Remote

This is the "Remote" for [Video Hub App](https://videohubapp.com/) (see [GitHub](https://github.com/whyboris/Video-Hub-App/)).

It lets you browse videos showing in _Video Hub App_ and make the app play videos on your computer by using your phone or tablet (when both are connected to the same WiFi).

The assets built with this repository are meant to be added into _Video Hub App_ before compiling.

### Developing

This is an *Angular* project.

- `npm install` to install
- `npm start` to develop
- `npm run build` to build

You will likely need to [allow CORS](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/allow-cors-access-control/lhobafahddgcelffkeicbaginigeejlf).

In _Chrome Developer Tools_ click _Toggle device toolbar_ to interact using "touch events" (not mouse clicks).
